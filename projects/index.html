						<h2>Trivia Bot</h2>
					</header>
					<p>A bot used to solve trivia questions from games such as HQ.</p>
					<p>HQ Trivia is a popular live trivia game which awards cash prizes to users who manage to answer all questions asked during the show correctly. The game asks questions across a myriad of genres, making it extremely difficult to win. Trivia Bot provides some help along the way.</p>
					<div class="row gtr-150">
						<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/hq-trivia.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h3>HQ Trivia Gameplay</h3>
							<p>The game provides 3 options to answer a question within 10 seconds. The bot listens to the game's question stream via websockets and leverages online search engines to help the user by quickly suggesting the most relevant answer.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/bot-text.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h3>Trivia Bot Output</h3>
							<p>Trivia Bot searches online and suggests the most relevant answer for each question. The numbers next to each option represent the number of matches found online for that particular answer when searching the question. The additional queries represent more complicated but slightly riskier analysis using NLP, question + answer concatenation and other methods.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/evolution.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h3>Evolution</h3>
							<p>The first iteration of the bot used QuickTime media player to capture and mirror the output of an iPhone screen to a Macbook screen. The bot would then take a screenshot and use Google OCR to extract the question and answer text. However, this process resulted in a lot of OCR inaccuracies and long runtimes for the bot.</p>
							<p>To solve this, Charles Web Debugging Proxy was used to intercept traffic from the HQ game (iPhone application) and discover credentials such as API keys and websocket streams feeding questions to the game. This evolution siginificantly increased both the speed and accuracy of the bot.</p>

								<h2>Seat Monitor</h2>
							</header>
							<p>A web application used to monitor class enrollment at UCLA.</p>
							<p>UCLA is one of the largest colleges by student population and notoriously difficult for enrolling into certain classes. Oftentimes, students will constantly monitor the enrollment of a class to try and find open seats. Seat Monitor provides a portal where users can register with email/phone number and input classes that they want to monitor. The application leverages a script to monitor the enrollment of those classes and send users a real-time email or SMS notification when spots become available in the class. Users can also log back into the portal at any time to modify their classes or preferences.</p>

								<h2>Pulse Sensor</h2>
							</header>
							<p>A pulse monitor circuit that measures a user's heart rate.</p>
							<p>Pulse Sensor measures a user's pulse by calculating voltage changes caused by the user's finger resting on an infrared transmitter/receiver diode circuit. The myDAQ acquires data from the circuit and the pulse is visualized with a graph in LabVIEW. An Arduino is used to calculate the BPM and display it on the screen.</p>
